<h4 class="open-sans open-sans--18 open-sans--grey open-sans--regular open-sans--padding-bottom">Context</h4>

<p class="open-sans open-sans--16">Mises Institute – an Austrian Economics nonprofit organization – created “FedWatch.” “FedWatch” is an online commentary series about the Federal Reserve and central banking. Mises Institute asked for a social media campaign to introduce “FedWatch” to current and hopefully new readers. </p>

<h4 class="open-sans open-sans--18 open-sans--regular open-sans--padding-bottom">Solution</h4>

<p class="open-sans open-sans--16">Many of the founding fathers – including those on the currency today – <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/270909/founders-no-fans-paper-currency-deroy-murdock">opposed fiat currency.</a> I “defaced” the currency – using masks to portray the mysterious Federal Reserve. I believed this uncanny imagery could be understood by Mises supporters as well as attract new readers. The circle motif represents a spotlight.</p>
