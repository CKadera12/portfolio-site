<p>In early 2017, the Mises Institute – an Austrian Economics organization – created “FedWatch.” “FedWatch” is an online commentary series about the Federal reserve and central banking. The Fed supports purposeful inflation, controlled interest rates, and fiat currency; Mises Institute opposes these things. The Mises Institute wanted to create a digital campaign kickoff for “FedWatch.”
